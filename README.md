# Google Photos Magisk Module

## DISCLAIMER
- Google apps are owned by Google LLC
- The MIT license specified here is for the Magisk Module only, not for Google apps.

## Descriptions
- Gallery app by Google LLC integrated as a Magisk Module for all supported and rooted devices with Magisk
- Usually, GApps installs Photos.apk in */app instead of */priv-app because it refers to default location on Google Pixel ROM. However, Photos.apk will not run properly on custom ROMs which usually have different signature than the Photos.apk because the WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE permission is not granted. This module places Photos.apk into */priv-app instead and whitelist the WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE permission so it runs it's function correctly on any ROM.
- You can run this terminal command to see is the WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE permission granted (true) or not (false):

`su`

`dumpsys package com.google.android.apps.photos | grep WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE`
